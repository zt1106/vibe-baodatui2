# Vibe Frontend (Godot 4.5)

This folder contains a minimal Godot 4.5 project that can be used as the basis for the game's client.

## Requirements

- [Godot Engine 4.5](https://godotengine.org/)

## Getting Started

1. Launch Godot 4.5.
2. From the project manager choose **Import**, then select `project.godot` in this directory.
3. Open the project and run it (`F5`) to see the placeholder scene.

The root scene is `main.tscn`, which currently shows a centered label. Replace or extend this scene as you build out the game's UI and gameplay.
